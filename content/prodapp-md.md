Developed an open source productivity web application with multiple features, like a pomodoro timer, kanban boards where you can move cards in different lists by drag'n'dropping them, dynamic routes and nav buttons based on a user's installed extensions, a store where you can install the extensions you want to use as well as the app's home page.
